# Chess Engine
This is a improved Chess Engine that utilizes various algorithms and techniques to improve its gameplay. Some of the key features of this Chess Engine include:

- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Parallelization
- Move Ordering
- Null Move Pruning
- Late Move Reduction (LMR)
- Opening Book
- Quiescence
- Transposition Tables
- Advanced Evaluation Function

The engine can be run either in the console or as a GUI. The console provides commands to reset the board, load positions, evaluate positions, and flip the board. The engine supports both human and AI players for both black and white pieces.

## Running the Engine
To run the engine, simply clone the repository and run the Main class.

## Using the Console
When running the engine in the console, the following commands are available:

- 'reset' - Resets the board to the starting position
- 'load <FEN>' - Loads a board position in FEN format
- 'eval' - Evaluates the current board position
- 'flip' - Flips the board so that the opponent's perspective is shown
- 'move <move>' - Makes a move on the board (for human players). (You can also drag and drop)
